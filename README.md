# Kubernetes Cluster API Provider Kubevirt

Kubernetes-native declarative infrastructure for Kubevirt.

## What is the Cluster API Provider Kubevirt?

The [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) brings declarative Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true Kubevirt hybrid deployments of Kubernetes.

## Quick Start

Checkout our [Cluster API Quick Start](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html) to create your first Kubernetes cluster.
